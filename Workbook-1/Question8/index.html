    <h1>Question 8:</h1>
    <pre>
You'll create a simple word predictor game where the user gets infinite tries to
guess the word.

    ● Create two global arrays: one to hold the letters of the word (e.g. 'F', 'O', 'X'),
    and one to hold the current guessed letters (e.g. it would start with '_', '_', '_'
    and end with 'F', 'O', 'X').
    ● Write a function called predictLetter that will:
        ○ Take one argument, the guessed letter.
        ○ Iterate through the word letters and see if the guessed letter is in there.
        ○ If the guessed letter matches a word letter, change the guessed letters
        array to reflect that.
        ○ When it's done iterating, it should log the current guessed letters ('F__')
        ○ and congratulate the user if they found a new letter.
        ○ It should also figure out if there are any more letters that need to be
        guessed,
        ○ and if not, it should congratulate the user for winning the game.
    ● Pretend you don't know the word, and call predictLetter multiple times with
    various letters to check that your program works.
